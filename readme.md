# BlhackerNews

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ap55ig5g0o27pcn7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Roxtar10/blhackernews)

BlhackerNews (hadn't any better idea sorry) is a minimal distraction free (no comments!) OLED black clone for [HackerNews](news.ycombinator.com/news). Results are based [HackerNews FireBase API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

BlhackerNews can of course be used as is to read top news from [HackerNews](news.ycombinator.com/news) but it's main goal is for me to play arround with ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 4.

Thanks to [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for providing free continuous integration for open-source projects.
