BlhackerNews (hadn't any better idea sorry) is a minimal distraction free (no comments!) OLED black clone for [HackerNews](news.ycombinator.com/news). Results are based [HackerNews FireBase API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

BlhackerNews can of course be used as is to read top news from [HackerNews](news.ycombinator.com/news) but it's main goal is to improve my skills with ASP.NET Core and Angular.
